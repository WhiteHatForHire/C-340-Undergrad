Write a function that cumputes the average and standard deviation of four scores.
The standard deviation is defined to be the square root of the average of the four
values: (si-1)^2, where a is the average of the four scores s1,s2,s3,s4. The function
will have six parameters and will call two other functions. Embed the function
in a program that allows you to test the function again and again until you tell the
program you are finished.
